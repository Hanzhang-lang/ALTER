To find the points of the last player, we can use the fact that the gap between the first and last rank is 18. Since the rank of the last player is 19, we can calculate the points of the last player by subtracting 18 from the rank of the first player's points.

Points of the last player = Points of the first player - (18 * gap between ranks)
Points of the last player = 172.42 - (18 * 29.38) = 172.42 - 529.44 = -357.02

Therefore, the points of the last player would be -357.02.

Now, we can calculate the total gap between the first and last rank by subtracting the points of the last player from the points of the first player.

Total gap = Points of the first player - Points of the last player
Total gap = 172.42 - (-357.02) = 172.42 + 357.02 = 529.44

Therefore, the total gap between the first and last rank is 529.44, not 58.04 as claimed.

Hence, the claim that the gap between the first and last rank being a total of 58.04 is false.

Therefore, the final answer is 0.",3643

From the sub-table provided:
- Mark Cockerell's final score was 172.42 points.

Since Mark Cockerell's final score of 172.42 points is higher than Patrice Macrez's final score of 151.76 points, the claim that Mark Cockerell finished with a worse score than Patrice Macrez is FALSE.

The rank of the first player is 1.
The rank of the last player is 19.","To verify the claim that the gap between the first and last player in terms of points is less than 50, we need to calculate the difference between the points of the first player (rank = 1) and the last player (rank = 19).

Given:
- Points of the first player (rank = 1): 172.42
- Points of the last player (rank = 19): Not provided

Since the points of the last player are not provided in the sub-table, we can calculate the maximum and minimum points from the entire table to determine the gap between the first and last player.

From the SQL query:
- Maximum points in the table: (SELECT MAX(points) FROM DF) = 230.46
- Minimum points in the table: (SELECT MIN(points) FROM DF) = 172.42

Now, we can calculate the gap between the first and last player:
Gap = Maximum points - Minimum points
Gap = 230.46 - 172.42
Gap = 58.04

The calculated gap between the first and last player in terms of points is 58.04, which is greater than 50. Therefore, the claim that the gap between the first and last player is less than 50 points is false.
