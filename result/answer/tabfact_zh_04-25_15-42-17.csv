"To verify whether the claim ""the sweet dream episode happened later in the series than the witchfinder"" is true or false, we need to compare the values in the ""no_for_series"" column for the episodes ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""The Witchfinder"".

From the sub-table provided:
- The Witchfinder has a ""no_for_series"" value of 7.
- Sweet Dreams has a ""no_for_series"" value of 10.

Since the ""no_for_series"" value for Sweet Dreams (10) is greater than the ""no_for_series"" value for The Witchfinder (7), we can conclude that the claim is true.

Therefore, the claim ""the sweet dream episode happened later in the series than the witchfinder"" is true.

"To verify the claim ""David Moore directed 3 episodes of series 2 of Merlin,"" we can refer to the SQL query and the information provided in the sub-table.

The SQL query specifically filters for episodes directed by David Moore with a series number of 3. Since the sub-table generated from this query shows no data, it means that there are no episodes directed by David Moore in series 3 of Merlin.

Therefore, the claim that David Moore directed 3 episodes of series 2 of Merlin is false.

"To verify the claim that David Moore directed 5 episodes of series 2 of Merlin, we can follow these steps:

1. Look at the SQL query: The SQL query filters the data to only count titles where the director is 'David Moore' and the title contains 'series 2'. The result of the query is 0, indicating that there are no titles that meet these criteria.

2. Extra information: The extra information provided states that David Moore directed 3 episodes in series 2 of Merlin.

3. Compare the information: The extra information contradicts the result of the SQL query. The query result suggests that David Moore did not direct any episodes in series 2, while the extra information states that he directed 3 episodes.

Therefore, the claim that David Moore directed 5 episodes of series 2 of Merlin is false.

"To verify the claim that 4 players scored 3 goals in total and all 4 are in league 4, we need to follow these steps:

1. Check the total number of players who scored 3 goals in total: Based on the sub-table, there are 5 players who scored 3 goals in total.

2. Check the number of players in league 4: Based on the sub-table, there are 3 players in league 4.

3. Compare the number of players who scored 3 goals in total and are in league 4: Since there are 5 players who scored 3 goals in total and only 3 players in league 4, it is not possible for all 4 players to be in league 4.

Therefore, the claim that 4 players scored 3 goals in total and all 4 are in league 4 is false.

Based on the sub-table and the claim/query:
1. The sub-table shows that Natalia Strelkova has a rank of 13, which means she did not lose the skating championship.
2. The sub-table does not provide information about Natalia Strelkova's gender, so we cannot confirm whether she is female or not.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can only confirm that Natalia Strelkova did not lose the skating championship. We cannot confirm whether she is female or not.

"To verify the claim that the gap between the first and last player's points is a total of 58.04, we need to calculate the difference between the points of the first and last player based on the given information.

Given:
- Total gap between the first and last rank is 18.
- Rank of the first player is 1.
- Rank of the last player is 19.

We can calculate the points of the first player by assuming the gap between each rank is the same:
Points of first player = Points of last player - Total gap between ranks * (Number of players - 1)
Points of first player = Points of last player - 18 * (19 - 1)
Points of first player = Points of last player - 18 * 18
Points of first player = Points of last player - 324

Now, let's compare this calculated point gap with the provided point gap of 58.04:
Calculated point gap = Points of last player - Points of first player
Calculated point gap = Points of last player - (Points of last player - 324)
Calculated point gap = 324

Since the calculated point gap is 324, which is not equal to the provided point gap of 58.04, the claim that the gap between the first and last player's points is a total of 58.04 is FALSE.

From the sub-table:
- Pierre Lamine scored 150.5 points
- Shinji Someya scored 150.34 points

To determine if Pierre Lamine beat Shinji Someya by more than a point, we need to calculate the difference in points between them:
150.5 - 150.34 = 0.16

Since the difference between Pierre Lamine's and Shinji Someya's points is 0.16, which is less than a point, the claim that Pierre Lamine beat Shinji Someya by more than a point is false.
