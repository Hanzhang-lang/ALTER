Cannot get answer from sub-table.
""The witchfinder"" is the episode in the series.","To verify the claim that the episode ""sweet dreams"" happened later in the series than ""the witchfinder"", we need to compare the values in the ""no_overall"" column for both episodes.

From the sub-table:
- ""sweet dreams"" has a ""no_overall"" value of 23
- ""the witchfinder"" has a ""no_overall"" value of 20

Since the ""no_overall"" value for ""sweet dreams"" (23) is greater than the ""no_overall"" value for ""the witchfinder"" (20), we can conclude that the claim is true.

Therefore, the claim that the episode ""sweet dreams"" happened later in the series than ""the witchfinder"" is true.

Since we cannot see the actual data in the sub-table, we cannot directly verify the claim. However, based on the filtering logic of the SQL query, we can infer that the sub-table only includes competitors from France who finished with a rank of less than 5.

Given that the point difference between the first and last rank is 58.04, and the rank of the player with the highest points is 1, we can calculate the points of the player with the lowest rank (19) as follows:

Points of player with rank 19 = Points of player with rank 1 + Point difference between first and last rank
Points of player with rank 19 = 172.42 + 58.04
Points of player with rank 19 = 230.46

Now, we can compare the points of the player with rank 19 (230.46) to the points of the player with rank 12 (143.04) to see if the gap is less than 50 points:

230.46 - 143.04 = 87.42

Since the gap between the points of the player with rank 19 and the player with rank 12 is 87.42, which is greater than 50 points, the claim that the gap between the first and last rank is less than 50 points is false.

From the extra information provided:
- Finland and United States received the same number of bronze medals.
- 2 different countries received the same number of bronze medals.
- Italy received the same number of bronze medals as Austria.

Based on the information provided, we can infer the following:
- Finland and United States are 2 countries with the same number of bronze medals.
- Italy and Austria are 2 countries with the same number of bronze medals.
- There are 2 additional pairs of countries with the same number of bronze medals.

3. The extra information states that the highest score for a winning team in the table is 18 and the lowest score is 11.

Based on the provided information and the results of the SQL query, we can conclude that the claim is false. The lowest score for a winning team in the table is actually 11, not 13 as stated in the claim.

Therefore, the claim that the highest score for a winning team is 18 and the lowest score for a winning team is 13 is false. The correct statement is that the highest score is 18 and the lowest score is 11.
