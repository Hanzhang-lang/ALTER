2-12582968-1.html.csv,european junior championships,"To verify the claim/query ""lukáš melich's highest finish be as a junior"", we need to look at the provided SQL query and the sub-table generated from it.

The SQL query filters the data from the table DF based on two conditions:
1. The competition column must contain the word 'junior' (case insensitive) using the LIKE operator.
2. The position column must not contain the substring 'th' using the NOT LIKE operator.

Based on the provided SQL query, the MAX(position) value is being retrieved from the filtered data.

Now, let's analyze the extra information provided:
- ""european junior championships"" matches the condition of containing the word 'junior'.
- ""lukáš melich's highest finish be as a junior"" implies that Lukáš Melich achieved his highest finish as a junior.

Since the SQL query is filtering data related to junior competitions and Lukáš Melich's highest finish is claimed to be as a junior, we can conclude that the claim is true.

Therefore, the final answer is 1.",4884

The SQL query is selecting the quarterback and counting the distinct uniform numbers associated with each quarterback from the table DF. It then groups the results by quarterback and filters the results to only include quarterbacks with exactly 2 unique uniform numbers.

Since the sub-table is not provided, we cannot directly verify the claim. However, based on the SQL query logic and the extra information provided, we know that there are 19 different uniform numbers among Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks. Additionally, Brian Sipe has the most games started as a Cleveland Browns starting quarterback.

Given this information, it is unlikely that 3 Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have exactly 2 different uniform numbers, as there are a total of 19 unique uniform numbers among them. Therefore, the claim that 3 of the Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have 2 different uniform numbers is likely false.

Therefore, the answer is 0 (false).",4943

2. Total games won by Cleveland Brown's quarterbacks:
   - According to the extra information, Cleveland Brown's quarterbacks who have won more than 10 games started a total of 641 games.

3. Compare the total unique quarterbacks to the total games won:
   - Since there are only 10 unique quarterbacks listed in the sub-table and the total games won by Cleveland Brown's quarterbacks is 641, it is evident that the claim that only 10 Cleveland Brown's quarterbacks have won more than 10 games is false.
