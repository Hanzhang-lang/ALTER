Harry says that he knows how to dance so Dee Dee feels left out because he doesn't know how to dance. Later on, Harry admits to Dee Dee alone that he can't dance either and only lied so he doesn't get teased by Donnell. So, they ask Alfie to help them learn how to dance. He refuses to help because Dee Dee previously told on him to Roger about his and Goo's plans to cheat on their math quiz. Alfie eventually agrees, after Melanie threatens to refuse to help him with his math homework. Soon Dee Dee and Harry learn Donnell's secret and were forced to teach him how to dance.
