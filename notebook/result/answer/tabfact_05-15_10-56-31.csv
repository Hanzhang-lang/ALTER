Counting the distinct values in the ""season"" column of the sub-table, we find that there are 45 distinct seasons listed (1965-2009).

First, we need to understand what ""natural change"" means in this context. Natural change is the difference between the number of live births and the number of deaths in a given population. So, to have 2,500,000 natural changes per year, there should be 2,500,000 more births than deaths.

Now, let's check the claim:
During the period of 1950-1955, there were 900,000 deaths per year.

If the number of births during 1950-1955 is greater than 3,400,000 (900,000 deaths + 2,500,000 natural change), then the claim is true.

If the number of births during 1950-1955 is less than 3,400,000, then the claim is false.
