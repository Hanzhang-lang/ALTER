Now, we need to find the total number of goals scored by the top 19 scorers in the Belgian first division. Let's assume the total number of goals scored by the top 19 scorers is X.

The claim states that the top scorer (Matias Suarez) has 8 fewer goals than Mbark Boussoufa, who has 11 goals.

So, we can calculate the total number of goals scored by the top 19 scorers as follows:
X = 11 (Mbark Boussoufa's goals) + 8 (difference in goals) + 3 (Matias Suarez's goals)
X = 22

Now, we compare the total number of goals scored by the top 19 scorers (X) with the given information that the top 19 scorers combined had 84 goals.

Since X = 22 and the top 19 scorers combined had 84 goals, the claim is false.

"To verify the claim that ""Brian Watt won exactly 1 major tournament"", we need to understand the logic behind the SQL filtering used in the query.

The SQL query selects all rows from the table DF where the column wins is equal to 1 and the column tournament contains the word ""championship"". This means that the query is looking for records where a player has won exactly 1 tournament and the tournament name contains the word ""championship"".

If the sub-table returned no data from the database, it means that there are no records in the table DF where a player has won exactly 1 tournament with the word ""championship"" in its name.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the claim ""Brian Watt won exactly 1 major tournament"" is false, as there are no records in the database that match this criteria.

Let's say the minimum number of matches played by an Australian player is 5.

Now, we compare the number of matches played by Jim Laker (3) with the minimum number of matches played by an Australian player (5).

Therefore, the claim ""rik de voest be alex bogdanovic's opponent on April 4, 2011"" is false.

Based on the provided extra information, the claim is that in the year 1971, Alberto Pagani won 2 times in the same year. The SQL query is checking for this specific scenario.

2. The champion is ""karrie webb"" and the year is 2010 or 2011.

However, the sub-table shows ""No data from database"", which means there is no record that satisfies the conditions specified in the SQL query.

Therefore, the claim that ""karrie webb was the runner up in 2008 and became the champion in 2010 and 2011"" is false.

Looking at the sub-table, we can see that Se Ri Pak was indeed the champion in 2001 and the runner-up in 2003. 

Therefore, the claim ""Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001, then came in 2nd place 2 years after"" is true.

We know that Jiyai Shin earned 428650 in 2012, and the query states that she earned 36517 less than Yani Tseng in 2011. 
So, Yani Tseng's earnings in 2012 would be 428650 + 36517 = 465167.

Now, let's compare Yani Tseng's earnings in 2011 and 2012:
- Yani Tseng earned $392,133 in 2011
- Yani Tseng earned $465,167 in 2012

From the provided information, we know that the Dolphins had a win on September 11, 1983 with a score of 34-24 and a win on September 4, 1983 with a score of 12-0. These wins would be included in the filtered results.

The claim is that the Dolphins finished the regular season with a 12-4 record. To verify this, we need to calculate the total number of wins for the Dolphins. From the provided information, we have 2 wins. 

So, the claim is false. The Dolphins did not finish the regular season with a 12-4 record.

1. Week 1, the Dolphins won against the Buffalo Bills with a score of w 12 - 0
2. Week 12, the Dolphins won against the Baltimore Colts with a score of w 37 - 0

Looking at the sub-table, we can see that the result for the row included is 'w 38 - 14', indicating that the Dolphins scored 38 points in that game.

Now, looking at the extra information provided, we can see that the highest point score by the Dolphins in a game is indeed 38, as indicated by the 'w 38 - 14' result in the sub-table.

Based on the provided sub-table and the extra information, it can be verified that the claim ""the lowest attendance figure for a game is 32343"" is true. This is because the sub-table only includes rows where the attendance figure is 32343 or higher, and there is no mention of any lower attendance figure in the provided information.

2. It excludes rows where the 'result' column contains a hyphen (-).
3. It excludes rows where the 'result' column contains the letter 'T'.

Given the extra information provided, we can see that the query does not directly match the information about the Dolphins' defense recording shutouts during the 1983 season. Therefore, the claim ""The Dolphins' defense recorded 3 shutouts during the 1983 season"" is false.

"First, let's break down the SQL query:
```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DF WHERE home = 'minnesota' - 2 = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DF WHERE visitor = 'minnesota')```

This query is counting the number of rows where the home team is 'minnesota' minus 2, and comparing it to the count of rows where the visitor team is 'minnesota'.

Now, let's calculate the values:
- The Minnesota Wild played 6 home games during the 2007-08 season.
- Minnesota played 14 games at home and 14 games away during the 2007-08 season.

So, the number of home games played by Minnesota is 6, and the number of away games played by Minnesota is 14.

Now, let's substitute these values into the query:
```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DF WHERE 6 - 2 = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DF WHERE visitor = 'minnesota')```

This simplifies to:
```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DF WHERE 4 = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DF WHERE visitor = 'minnesota')```

Now, let's calculate the count of rows where the visitor team is 'minnesota':
The visitor team is 'minnesota' for 14 games.

So, the query becomes:
```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM DF WHERE 4 = 14```

This is not true, so the query returns 0.

Therefore, the claim that ""during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota played home 2 times less than they played away"" is false.

"Step 1: Count the total number of decisions made during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season.

Step 2: Compare the number of decisions made by Backstrom and Harding.
Backstrom's decisions = 11
Harding's decisions = 3

Step 3: Check if the claim ""the decision be backstrom 11 time more than it be harding"" is true.
11 times more than Harding would be 3 * 11 = 33
But Backstrom's decisions are only 11, which is not 11 times more than Harding's decisions.

2. The score should be in the format '% - %' and the first part of the score should be less than the second part minus 2.
3. The date should be either 'february 27' or 'february 29'.

Now, let's analyze the claim:
""During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota lost by more than 2 on February 27 and February 29.""

Based on the SQL query and the claim, we can conclude the following:
1. The visitor is 'minnesota', which matches the claim.
2. The score should be in the format '% - %' and the first part of the score should be less than the second part minus 2. This condition is not directly related to the claim, so we can ignore it for now.
3. The date should be either 'february 27' or 'february 29', which matches the claim.

After counting the occurrences, we can compare the frequencies of ""engine trouble"" and ""overheating"" to determine if the claim is true or false.

Based on the provided sub-table, we can see that ""overheating"" appears twice in the time_retired column.
